# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on stock-related news headlines using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis helps investors gauge market sentiment and make informed decisions by analyzing the sentiment expressed in news articles and headlines. In this project, we utilize machine learning and NLP tools to classify news headlines into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. The code includes data preprocessing steps, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, we provide examples of how to use the trained model for sentiment analysis on new unseen data. This project aims to provide valuable insights for investors and traders by leveraging NLP techniques for sentiment analysis in the stock market context.
